- Git & GitHub are already built-in in Atom.
- All the features of them are located in upper down corner.
- If Project's name in green color, then it means there is a new file created
  If Project's name in beige color, then it means there is change made in file

  To Use GitHub Features In Atom:

  Save changes in File -> Git (down the corner) ->
  Stage All (if you are choosing all unstaged changes)
  Double-Click (if you are choosing selectively) ->  Commit comment -> Close

  Undo   -   undoes the last commit
